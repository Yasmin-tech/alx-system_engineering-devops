# 0x14. MyQL

In this project, we were asked to install MySQL on my two servers and implement one of its built-in replication features.
We will use the Master-Slave configuration.

### The tasks include:

 - Get MySQL installed on both your web-01 and web-02 servers.
		 - MySQL distribution must be 5.7.x
