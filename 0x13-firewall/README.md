**0x13-firewall**
A firewall is a crucial network security tool that oversees and regulates both incoming and outgoing network traffic. Based on a predetermined set of security regulations, it determines whether to authorize or deny specific traffic. Firewalls can be deployed as hardware, software, or a combination of the two, and can be utilized as a service, in the router, the load balancer, or on the local machine.

## In this project:

I will -   Configure  `ufw`  so that it blocks all incoming traffic, except the following TCP ports:
    -   `22`  (SSH)
    -   `443`  (HTTPS SSL)
    -   `80`  (HTTP)
