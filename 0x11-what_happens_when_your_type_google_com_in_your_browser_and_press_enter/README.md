In this project, we were asked to write a blog post on Linked In or Medium about What happens when you type google.com in your browser and press Enter

The purpose of this project is to be able to explain the different components of computer networking. I tried to explain and reference the process based on the OSI model. I covered these topics:

-   DNS request
    
-   TCP/IP
    
-   Firewall
    
-   HTTPS/SSL
    
-   Load-balancer
    
-   Web server
    
-   Application server
    
-   Database
